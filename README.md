# The Right to AI Page

**The Right to AI Page** is a Next.js web application that supports public understanding and participation in the governance of artificial intelligence. It is part of a broader non-profit initiative that began as a multi-year collaboration with over 30 community organizations across Montréal.

This site hosts interactive content, public-facing explanations of AI infrastructure, and resources for workshops, research, and community engagement. It is designed to help people explore both the promises and risks of AI, and to co-develop tools for more democratic oversight of data and algorithmic systems.

## Features

- A declaration that invites individuals and organizations to co-sign the Right to AI  
- Educational content on how AI affects public space, finance, health, and daily life  
- Materials for community workshops and participatory research  
- Opportunities to volunteer, contribute, or stay informed through a mailing list
